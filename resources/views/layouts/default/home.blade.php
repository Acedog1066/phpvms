                    Oh! I have slipped the surly bonds of earth,<br />
                    And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings;<br />
                    Sunward I've climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth<br />
                    Of sun-split clouds, --and done a hundred things<br />
                    You have not dreamed of --Wheeled and soared and swung<br />
                    High in the sunlit silence. Hov'ring there<br />
                    I've chased the shouting wind along, and flung<br />
                    My eager craft through footless halls of air...<br />
                    Up, up the long, delirious, burning blue<br />
                    I've topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace<br />
                    Where never lark or even eagle flew --<br />
                    And, while with silent lifting mind I've trod<br />
                    The high untrespassed sanctity of space,<br />
                    Put out my hand, and touched the face of God.<br />
